## Welcome to nostrCI ðŸ‘‹



### What is nostrCI?

nostrCI is the automated tracking of continuous integration of nostr apps A, B.. N. 

### nostr CI objective

The obective of nostrCI is to continuously test, score, and document the interactions between nostr apps. 

### What problem is nostrCI solving?

While [nostr protocol](https://github.com/nostr-protocol), and [NIPs](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips) exist, there exist uncertainties and permutations in implementing both protocol, and NIPs. 
Furthermore, the understanding of base spec and NIPs evolves with exprience and time. 

While [nostrability](github.com/nostrability) relies on manual reports, the intent of nostrCI is to automagically, and continously test the cross-compatibility of nostr apps. The end result should be a 
scorecard of nostr apps cross-compatibility rating with other nostr apps. 

### Preliminary nostr CI requirements

1. Ideally automagic bot that can test cross-compatibility between nostr app A, B.. N and so on \
2. There is a human readable report/matrix or other method that clearly indicates issues in cross compatibility of clients \
3. Bot documents issues (e.g. broken contact lists, lost relays etc) \
4. Iot documents recreatable order of events that leads to poor or lack of cross-compatibility \
5. Ideally bot either periodically tests apps, or detects new releases of apps, which in turns triggers cross-compatibility testing

### Looking for dev(s) 

I am looking for a dev to help buidl nostrCI. 

### Funding

Upon track record, and success, this project _may_ be a candidate for [Opensats](https://opensats.org/) funding down the road.
